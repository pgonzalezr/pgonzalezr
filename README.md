Greetings!!!!!!

I'm Pedro Gonzalez, a SW Test engineer with focus on test automation & CI/CD practices from Mexico(Open for interesting opportunities abroad if you have one ;)).

Most of my work is on private repos, but you can get an idea of my past work from my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgonzalezr/).

I have experience with creating test automation frameworks with different tools such as Selenium, Protractor & Watir.

I've also done a bit of backend development work using Java.

Currently studying python & js to switch to another type of roles.

You'll find some info about a couple of public presentations/contributions I'll do in 2020 [here](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-netherlands-online-2020) and [here](https://leanpub.com/AroundTheWorldWith80SoftwareTesters).

Best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:lia.pedro.gonzalez@gmail.com), or you can always say hi to me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/pgonzalezr).
