###Greetings :

I'm Pedro Gonzalez, a SW Test engineer with focus on test automation & CI/CD practices from Mexico

Most of my work is on private repos, but you can get an idea of my past work from my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pgonzalezr/

I have experience with creating test automation frameworks with different tools such as Selenium, Protractor & Watir.

I've also done a bit of backend development work using Java.

Currently studying python & js to switch to another type of roles.

Best way to reach me is via email which you can find in my profile, or you can always say hi to me via twitter(https://twitter.com/pgonzalezr).
